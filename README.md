### Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA involved exploring the marketing data to answer key questions such as;

* Which product is performing best?
* Which marketing campaign is the most successful and accepted?
* Which channels are used more by customers?
* Which country are most of the products sold?

### Results
  
* The first question asked was, which product is performing best?

  The product performing best is Wine, followed by other products such as Meat, Gold, Fish, Sweet and Fruits.

* The second question was, which marketing campaign is the most successful and has the highest acceptance rate?

  The most successful campaign is campaign 4 with a total of 164 customers that accepted the offer.

  The store is the most frequently used channel for shopping for products.

* The  fourth question was, which country are most of the products sold?
  
  ![Country](https://github.com/Layo-Oyenuga/Excel_Marketing_Analysis_Project/assets/141513681/af77fedc-f0c7-4bd3-971c-e26aa76d0b26)

 Most of the products such as wine, meat, fruits, sweets, fish and gold are being sold in Spain.
 
### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions;

 * Countries with least product purchased, marketing strategies for sales should be utilized to create more awareness to the products so as to increase revenue.

 * Catelogue channel should be made known more to cutomers during purchase of products.

 * Wine and meat should Always be available because there are the most sold products.

 * Campaign 2 should not be really regarded since it got the least campaign accepted by customer.
