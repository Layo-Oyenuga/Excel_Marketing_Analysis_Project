Spain has the highest products being sold.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

 * Countries with least product purchased, marketing strtaegies for sales should be utilized to create more awareness to the products so as to increase revenue.

 * Catelogue channel should be made known more to cutomers during purchase of products

 * Wine and meat should Always be available because it is the most sold product.

 * Campaign 2 should not be really regarded since it got the least campaign accepted by customer.
